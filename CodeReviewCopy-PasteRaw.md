# Code Review Copy-Paste Raw

```
###[Q] Broken Code - Use for questions where the code is not working correctly. It links to the Stack Overflow "how to ask" page so the user can read their guidelines before posting, to avoid getting down-voted or closed there.
If your code is not working correctly, it is off-topic for this site. You might try [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) if you can word the question in a way that fits the criteria on that page. Once your code works correctly, you're welcome to ask a new question here and we can then help you improve it!

###[Q] Code Not Written Yet - Use for questions where the OP wants all or part of the code written or modified.
Asking for advice on code yet to be written or implemented is off-topic for this site. See [What topics can I ask about?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) for reference. Once you have written working code, you're welcome to ask a new question here and we can then help you improve it!

###[Q] Code Not Written Yet - This version is intended more so for questions of the nature "<i>I need to do X, can you help writing the code?</i>"
We do not provide code-writing services here. We recommend that you search online tutorials and examples in order for you to learn how to write your own code. See [What topics can I ask about?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) for reference. Once you have written working code, you're welcome to ask a new question here and we can then help you improve it!

###[Q] Pseudo / Example / Stub Code - Use for questions where the code is either not written using a real language (pesudo-code), is obviously example code rather than real implementation, or where important parts of the code have been omitted.
The code you presented in its current form is not meaningfully reviewable. We only review real, working code. If you edit your question to contain your actual code we can review it for improvements. See [What topics can I ask about?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) for reference.

###[Q] No Description or Context Provided - Use for questions where little or no explanation is provided. This can often reasonably justify a vote to close as "Unclear what you're asking."
This question is incomplete. To help reviewers give you better answers, please add sufficient context to your question. The more you tell us about what your code does and what the purpose of doing that is, the easier it will be for reviewers to help you. [Questions should include a description of what the code does](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1231).

###[Q] Poor Title - Use for questions which have generic titles like "<i>How can I improve/shorten/speed up this code?</i>".
The current question title, which states your concerns about the code, applies to too many questions on this site to be useful. The site standard is for the title to simply state the task accomplished by the code. Please see [How do I ask a good question?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) for examples, and revise the title accordingly.

###[Q] Code Behind a Link - Use for questions where the code is not included in the post, and rather is behind a link, for example Github, gist, pastebin, repl.it, jsfiddle, sqlfiddle, etc.
Unfortunately your question is off-topic as of now, as the code to be reviewed must be [present in the question](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1308). Code behind links is considered non-reviewable. Please add the code you want reviewed in your question.

###[Q] Asking for Explanation of Code - Use for questions where the user is looking for someone to explain the code to them. Presumably, it is not code that they have written themselves
This question doesn't reflect what the site is about. We review code that you have written for improvements. It's not on-topic to ask for an explanation of code that has been written by someone other than you, or, in general, of code that you do not understand. See [What topics can I ask about?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic).

###[Q] Challenge Description Behind a Link - Use for "programming challenge" questions where the description of the challenge is behind a link, rather than included as part of the question.
Links can rot or become broken. [Please include a description of the challenge here in your question.](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1994)

###[Q] Answer Invalidation - Use for edits to questions that do invalidate answers, for example the OP changing or adding updated code into the question after receiving answers.
I have rolled back your last edit. Please don't change or add to the code in your question after you have received answers. See [What should I do when someone answers my question?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/someone-answers) Thank you.


###[A] Not An Answer - Use for answers that clearly do not answer the question at all, for example "<i>This really helped me!</i>" or someone asking a new question. This should also be accompanied by flagging as "Not An Answer" and probably a down-vote, at your discretion.
The answer you posted does not attempt to review the post in question. See [How do I write a good answer?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer) for reference.

###[A] Link-only Answer - Use for answers which are mostly or entirely links to another site, whether pointing to Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange or an external resource.
Link-only answers are discouraged in part because links can become stale or broken, and also because it doesn't really provide a review of the code in question. See [How do I write a good answer?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer) for reference.

###[A] Answer which is a Question - Use for answers which really should be questions of their own.
This isn't an answer to the question. If you have another question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/ask) button. If you are uncertain, take a look at [How do I ask a good question?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask)

###[A] Non-Review / Alternative Solution - Use for answers of the style "<i>try this instead</i>" to encourage the writer to add explanation to their answer.
You have presented an alternative solution, but haven't reviewed the code. Please explain your reasoning (how your solution works and why it is better than the original) so that the author and other readers can learn from your thought process.

###[A] Answer should be a Comment (<50 rep) - Use for answers that really should be a comment.
This is really a comment, not an answer. With a bit more rep, [you will be able to post comments](http://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/privileges/comment). For the moment I've added the comment for you, and I'm flagging this post for deletion.

###[A] Answer should be a Comment (>=50 rep) - Use for answers that really should be a comment.
This is really a comment, not an answer. Please use comments to ask for clarification, rather than using an answer post. I'm flagging this post for deletion.


###[Q] Off-topic because it belongs on Code Review - Use to inform a Stack Overflow user who comments on a question with something like "<i>I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it belongs on Code Review.</i>"
It is okay to recommend the OP post on CR but in the future, please don't use Code Review as a reason to close a question. Evaluate the request and use a reason like *too broad*, *primarily opinion-based*, etc. Then you can mention to the OP that it can be posted on Code Review if it is [on-topic](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic). Please see the section **What you should not do** in [this answer to A guide to Code Review for Stack Overflow users](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/5778)
